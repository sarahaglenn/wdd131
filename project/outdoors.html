                <p>There are five rivers in Skellefteå, three of which are classified as wild salmon rivers. Such a concentration of salmon waters cannot be found anywhere else in Sweden - and the crown jewel is Byske River. The Byske River is currently experiencing a positive trend. In 2015, more than 5,000 salmon passed through the Fällfors fish waterway. The year before that, nearly 6,000. These are impressive numbers and they have generated a lot of interest in the Byske River in recent years. </p>

                <p>"Skellefteå offers one of Sweden's best cross-country skiing systems up on Vitberget for those who want to go cross-country skiing. There is a wide range of easy tracks for families and exercisers, but also really tough and hilly ones for us who train hard and compete. In addition, there are about 30 additional tracks around the municipality that are run by associations and enthusiasts, which gives more people the opportunity to go cross-country skiing regularly. "
